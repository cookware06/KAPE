Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor (KAPE) is primarily a triage program that will target a device or storage location, find the most forensically relevant artifacts (based on your needs), and parse them within a few minutes. Because of its speed, KAPE allows investigators to find and prioritize the more critical systems to their case.

Purpose for keeping file as multiple time cames across issues in downloading file from the kape officil website. This package doesn't contain any modules. Just kape.exe utility and powershell script to download the modules and updates.

Note: Educational Purpose Only.

Big Thanks for Eric Zimmerman for this wonderful tool.
